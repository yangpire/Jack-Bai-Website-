      <p>My name is Jack Bai, and I was born in Inner Mongolia. I have multicultural education backgrounds. Currently, I study Urban Design at Columbia University in the city of New York. I also completed my studies with a masters degree in Landscape Architecture and acquired my LEED Green Associate in 2014. There, I had the opportunity to study design overseas in Finland where I worked with local design professionals and Finnish students on sustainable urban development design principles. My travel and study abroad experiences transformed my life and provided me another opportunity to analyze how other social infrastructures, such as Scandinavian, Asian, Middle Eastern and American, to operate in the city.
